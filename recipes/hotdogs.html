        <h3>The best Seattle-Style Cream Cheese Dog</h3>
        <h3><p>On the streets of Seattle, after the bars close, and during sporting events, these are a local favorite--warm cream cheese spread on your favorite hotdog!</p></h3>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
            <li>1 Walla Walla or other sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1(4 ounce) package of cream cheese</li>
            <li>4 hot dogs, or your favorite sausages</li>
            <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
            <li>brown mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup of sauerkraut</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><p>Steps</p></h3>

            <li>Preheat grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions, and cook slowly until the onions have softened and turned deep brown, about 15 minutes. Warm the cream cheese over low heat in a small skillet until very soft.</li>
